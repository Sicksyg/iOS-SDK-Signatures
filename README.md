# iOS-SDK-Signatures
A small database containing SDK signatures for use in iOS static and dynamic analysis.
Currently the database only contains the SDK signatures and not the domain signatures used in dynamic analysis.

# ToDo
- [x] Update list with new entries (continuously)
- [ ] Add domain signatures to SDKs
- [ ] Add comments to signatures

# Dataset
The original dataset was forked from the PlatformControl https://github.com/TrackerControl/PlatformControl:
